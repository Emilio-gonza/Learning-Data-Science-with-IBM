Assessments related with the professional certificate in Data Science
I am a lecturer in Economics at Comillas Pontifical University, ranked one of the top 150 best Business and Economics faculties in the world, according to Times Higher Education ranking. I got my PhD in Economics in 2012. I am learning Data Science in part because I needed it for academic research and, in part, because I want to become a professional Data Analyst.
